Remake map.cpp and map.h into a hex grid
- Map should be hexes, likely a 3d array
- Each hex should contain information such as amount of units, if theres a city, or resources
- Create rendering method for the hex grid
- https://catlikecoding.com/unity/tutorials/hex-map/ 
Clean up game.cpp 
- Not urgent, just some commented code and old stuff from when code was first set up.
Edit units to traverse hexes
- Units should be capable of recieving a command to go in a direction relating to a hexagon.
- Capable of validating the command to ensure they don't go anywhere invalid.
- Each instance of a unit should represent a stack of units in one hex space. There should not be multiple instances of a players unit in one space.
- Allow for units to merge if a stack moves into a player occupied space.
Implement json reader for configuration
- We will need to figure out what settings will be needed for the game
- Any variables that would use the json for configuration should have a default value in the event of the configuration not being there.
Set up game logic
- Implement units fighting
- Implement cities and taking over cities
- 
Map generation
- Set up map using variables from configuration
- map does not need to be uniform, there can be hexes that are not actually used in the game
